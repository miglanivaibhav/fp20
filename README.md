# Financial Statement Report
üß© The business case:
 A SaaS company needed to bridge the gap between budget and actual performance to uncover insights on profitability, overspending, and customer value. My dashboard helps leadership make faster, data-informed decisions about cost control and revenue strategy. Here's what I uncovered:

üìê Key KPIs Analyzed
- Total Revenue YTD
- Actual Net Profit
- Profit Margin (%)
- Actual Expenses
- Expense Variance (vs. Budget)
- Revenue Variance (vs. Budget)
- Net Profit Variance (Actual vs Budgeted)
- Month-over-Month (MoM) Profit %
- Year-over-Year (YoY) Profit %
- Budget Utilization Ratio ‚Äì Revenue
- Budget Utilization Ratio ‚Äì Expenses
- % of Expenses Processed by ADP
- % of Revenue from Various SMB Clients

üîç Key Insights:
- Total Revenue YTD reached $8.7M, but actual net profit was only $299.9K, with a slim profit margin of 3.5%.
- Expenses totaled $8.4M, with a variance of $622K above budget, primarily driven by operating costs, especially payroll.
- One vendor, ADP, alone accounts for 87.3% of payroll processing, contributing to over 50% of total monthly expenses across the year.
- Revenue concentration was high, with ~26% of total income from ‚ÄúVarious SMB‚Äù clients, highlighting potential risk.
- While actual revenue outpaced budgeted revenue in the latter half of the year, spending also increased, affecting profitability.

‚úÖ Recommendations:
- Vendor diversification: Reduce reliance on ADP and negotiate better rates or evaluate alternative providers to improve cost efficiency.
- Expense optimization: Closely monitor advertising, SaaS COGS, and professional services, which showed budget overruns in certain months.
- Client diversification strategy: Mitigate revenue risk by expanding focus beyond top-paying SMB clients to stabilize income streams.
- Improve budget forecasting: Regular variance analysis can help realign budgets more dynamically to operational trends.
